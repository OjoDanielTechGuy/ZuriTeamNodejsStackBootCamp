    <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
    <p>
      Hello! I am Daniel Ojo, I am dedicated to the quest of Web3 technologies. <br> <br>
      I value quality and enjoy structure and order. I really enjoy hanging out
      in the web3 world. <br> <br>
      I enjoy working in teams because you learn more
      quickly. Two heads are better than one, as the saying goes.
